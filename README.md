# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application that simulates the backend development of a platform like Airbnb. This project is designed to deepen your understanding of full-stack development, focusing on backend architecture, database design, API development, and system security. The project promotes collaborative teamwork, efficient planning, and hands-on experience with modern development tools.

## Project Goals

- Simulate a real-world booking system with scalable architecture.
- Strengthen backend development skills using Django, GraphQL, and MySQL.
- Learn how to work in collaborative team environments using GitHub.
- Build and document secure and efficient APIs.
- Set up automated CI/CD pipelines for deployment.

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for developing API endpoints, managing backend logic, and ensuring proper server-side integration.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and maintains the database structure, ensures data integrity, and optimizes queries for performance.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles CI/CD pipelines, manages deployment processes, and oversees infrastructure scaling using tools like Docker and GitHub Actions.

### Security Analyst
Implements security best practices, monitors for vulnerabilities, and ensures all sensitive data is protected.

### Project Manager
Oversees task distribution, timelines, and ensures consistent team communication and delivery of milestones.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A powerful Python web framework for building scalable RESTful APIs.
- **MySQL**: Relational database used to manage and store structured project data.
- **GraphQL**: A flexible query language used for efficient and precise data fetching.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool used to package and deploy the app consistently across environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD tool for automating build, test, and deployment workflows.

## Database Design

### Key Entities

1. **User**
   - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`
   - A user can be a host or guest.

2. **Property**
   - `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `host_id`
   - A property is listed by a host (user).

3. **Booking**
   - `id`, `property_id`, `user_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`
   - A booking belongs to a user and a property.

4. **Review**
   - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`
   - A review is written by a guest for a property.

5. **Payment**
   - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`
   - A payment is linked to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Handles user registration, login, role assignment, and profile updates. Ensures users are authenticated before accessing certain features.

### Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Guests can browse available properties using filters.

### Booking System
Guests can book properties for selected dates. Prevents overlapping bookings and calculates total price dynamically.

### Review System
Enables guests to leave reviews after completing a stay, helping build trust in the community.

### Payment Processing
Facilitates secure payment transactions for bookings, tracking status and history of payments.

## API Security

- **Authentication**: Only registered users can access protected routes using tokens or sessions.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control to ensure only hosts can manage properties.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against brute-force and DDoS attacks by limiting request frequency.
- **Data Validation**: Prevents injection and invalid data through thorough input validation.
- **Secure Payments**: Ensures that payment details are encrypted and processed securely.

Security is crucial for protecting user data, maintaining platform integrity, and building user trust in the application.

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)** automates the process of testing and deploying code changes, reducing manual errors and speeding up development.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment on push.
- **Docker**: Creates consistent, reproducible environments for development and production.
- **Heroku / Render / Railway** (optional): For streamlined deployment of the backend services.
